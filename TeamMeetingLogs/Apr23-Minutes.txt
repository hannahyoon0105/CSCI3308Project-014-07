Meeting 5 Minutes

Presented our presentation and demo

Total Time: 8 mins 52 seconds (we have space for another minute if we need)

Coryâ€™s advice: 
- Make sure that you introduce yourself at the beginning of the presentation
- Tools: change Visual Studio to vs code
- Demo: maybe make sure multiple people are talking, show registration/login flow more
- Be able to articulate 3 main features of product
- Architecture diagram is a little confusing, frontend is typically in the client side bubble, though probably fine if the frontend is in server side anyways
